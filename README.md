# 🚀 Day 0 — The Beginning of My 30 Days Embedded Systems with Arduino Challenge

Today marks the start of my 30-day journey into the world of **Embedded Systems and Arduino**.  
The goal is simple — learn something new every day, stay consistent, and document every bit of progress here.

---

## 💡 What I’m Doing
For the next 30 days, I’ll be learning, practicing, and building small embedded projects using Arduino.  
Each day, I’ll upload my code, circuit images, and short notes about what I learned.  
All my daily progress will live in this GitHub repository.

I’ll also share **weekly progress summaries** and small project highlights on LinkedIn.

---

## 🧠 My Focus
This challenge is not just about completing 30 days — it’s about improving consistency, clarity, and hands-on understanding of hardware and code working together.

---

## 🧩 Posting Plan
| Platform | Updates | Frequency |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **GitHub** | Daily progress, code, circuits, output photos | Every Day |
| **LinkedIn** | Weekly reflections & project updates | Every Sunday |

---

## ⚙️ My Commitment
> I’ll learn for around **2 focused hours every day**,  
> no excuses, no skipping — just one step closer to mastery, each day.

---

## 💭 Reflection
Day 0 is all about setting the stage.  
Created this repository, finalized the structure, and planned the learning flow for the next 30 days.  
Feeling excited and ready to dive in from tomorrow — **Day 1 begins the real work.**
