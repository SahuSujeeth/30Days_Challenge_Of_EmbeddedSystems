# Embedded-Systems-30Days-Challenge
🚀 30 Days of Embedded Systems with Arduino — A daily learning challenge to build consistency, deepen embedded knowledge, and create hands-on Arduino &amp; IoT projects. Daily progress, code, and circuits documented here.

# 🚀 Day 0 — The Beginning of My 30 Days Embedded Systems with Arduino Challenge

Today marks the start of my 30-day journey into the world of **Embedded Systems and Arduino**.  
The goal is simple — learn something new every day, stay consistent, and document every bit of progress here.

---

## 💡 What I’m Doing
For the next 30 days, I’ll be learning, practicing, and building small embedded projects using Arduino.  
Each day, I’ll upload my code, circuit images, and short notes about what I learned.  
All my daily progress will live in this GitHub repository.

I’ll also share **weekly progress summaries** and small project highlights on LinkedIn.

---

## 🧠 My Focus
This challenge is not just about completing 30 days — it’s about improving consistency, clarity, and hands-on understanding of hardware and code working together.

---

## 🧩 Posting Plan
| Platform | Updates | Frequency |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **GitHub** | Daily progress, code, circuits, output photos | Every Day |
| **LinkedIn** | Weekly reflections & project updates | Every Sunday |

---

## ⚙️ My Commitment
> I’ll learn for around **2 focused hours every day**,  
> no excuses, no skipping — just one step closer to mastery, each day.

---

## 💭 Reflection
Day 0 is all about setting the stage.  
Created this repository, finalized the structure, and planned the learning flow for the next 30 days.  
Feeling excited and ready to dive in from tomorrow — **Day 1 begins the real work.**

# 📘 Day 1 — Introduction to Embedded Systems

### 🧩 Overview
Today marks the start of my 30-Days of Embedded Systems with Arduino Challenge!  
On Day 1, I explored the **fundamentals of embedded systems** — how hardware and software integrate to form intelligent, real-time devices that power everything from washing machines to IoT nodes.

---

### ⚙️ Topics Covered
- What is an Embedded System & its Key Characteristics  
- Embedded System Building Blocks  
- Microcontroller vs Microprocessor  
- Digital & Analog Basics  
- Real-Time Concepts (Hard/Firm/Soft RT)  
- Interrupts, Timers, PWM, ADC — Core Arduino Foundations  
- Communication Interfaces (UART, SPI, I²C, CAN, etc.)  
- Embedded Software Stack  
- Power & Performance Management  
- Arduino Context — Understanding the UNO Architecture  
- Typical Embedded Project Dataflow  
- Common Interview Qs (Day-1 Level)

# 🔧 Day 2 — Memory Management + Arduino Basics (Button–LED with Tinkercad)

---

## 🧩 Overview

On Day 2 of my **30 Days Embedded Systems with Arduino** challenge, I focused on both:

- **Memory Management in Embedded Systems** (Flash, SRAM, EEPROM, segments)
- **Arduino Basics** (digital I/O, pin modes, simple input/output circuit)

I then built and tested a **Button-controlled LED circuit** using **two resistors**, both in **Tinkercad simulation** and on real hardware.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Memory Types in Microcontrollers:
  - Flash (program storage)
  - SRAM (runtime variables, stack)
  - EEPROM (persistent small data)
- Memory Segments:
  - Code/Text, .data, .bss, stack, heap
- Arduino UNO Memory Overview:
  - 32 KB Flash, 2 KB SRAM, 1 KB EEPROM
- Arduino Sketch Basics:
  - `setup()` and `loop()`
- Digital Input & Output:
  - `pinMode()`, `digitalRead()`, `digitalWrite()`
- Button with Pull-Down Resistor
- LED with Current-Limiting Resistor
- Using **Tinkercad** for circuit simulation

---

## 🔌 Circuit Summary

### 🔹 LED:
- Anode (long leg) → **Arduino Pin 12**  
- Cathode (short leg) → **220Ω resistor → GND**

### 🔹 Button (with 10kΩ Pull-Down):
- One side of button → **5V**  
- Other side → **Arduino Pin 2**  
- Same row as pin 2 → **10kΩ resistor → GND**

### 🧠 Behavior

| Button | Pin 2 Reads | LED |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| Not Pressed | LOW | OFF |
| Pressed | HIGH | ON |

---

## 🧪 Tinkercad Simulation

I used **Tinkercad** to:

- Build the same circuit virtually  
- Test button + LED behavior  
- Verify the code before/alongside hardware
