# 🔧 Day 2 — Memory Management + Arduino Basics (Button–LED with Tinkercad)

---

## 🧩 Overview

On Day 2 of my **30 Days Embedded Systems with Arduino** challenge, I focused on both:

- **Memory Management in Embedded Systems** (Flash, SRAM, EEPROM, segments)
- **Arduino Basics** (digital I/O, pin modes, simple input/output circuit)

I then built and tested a **Button-controlled LED circuit** using **two resistors**, both in **Tinkercad simulation** and on real hardware.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Memory Types in Microcontrollers:
  - Flash (program storage)
  - SRAM (runtime variables, stack)
  - EEPROM (persistent small data)
- Memory Segments:
  - Code/Text, .data, .bss, stack, heap
- Arduino UNO Memory Overview:
  - 32 KB Flash, 2 KB SRAM, 1 KB EEPROM
- Arduino Sketch Basics:
  - `setup()` and `loop()`
- Digital Input & Output:
  - `pinMode()`, `digitalRead()`, `digitalWrite()`
- Button with Pull-Down Resistor
- LED with Current-Limiting Resistor
- Using **Tinkercad** for circuit simulation

---

## 🔌 Circuit Summary

### 🔹 LED:
- Anode (long leg) → **Arduino Pin 12**  
- Cathode (short leg) → **220Ω resistor → GND**

### 🔹 Button (with 10kΩ Pull-Down):
- One side of button → **5V**  
- Other side → **Arduino Pin 2**  
- Same row as pin 2 → **10kΩ resistor → GND**

### 🧠 Behavior

| Button | Pin 2 Reads | LED |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| Not Pressed | LOW | OFF |
| Pressed | HIGH | ON |

## 🧪 Tinkercad Simulation

I used **Tinkercad** to:

- Build the same circuit virtually  
- Test button + LED behavior  
- Verify the code before/alongside hardware

# 🔦 Day 3 — Multiple LEDs & Pattern Logic

Today I worked with **multiple LEDs** and learned how to create light animation patterns using Arduino.  
This step builds logical thinking needed for future topics like sequencing, motor control, buzzer tones, and real output systems.

---

### 🔧 What I Learned

- How to control multiple outputs using Arduino pins
- Use of **loops and arrays** to clean repeated LED code
- Creating patterns like:
  - Simultaneous blink (basic)
  - Sequential blink
  - Ping-Pong / Knight Rider effect
- Structured code approach (no repetition, scalable logic)

### 🧪 Circuit Overview

| LED | Arduino Pin | Resistor |
|-----|-------------|-----------|
| LED1 | D9 | 220Ω |
| LED2 | D8 | 220Ω |
| LED3 | D7 | 220Ω |

All cathodes are connected to **GND through resistors**.

📌 LED Rule:  
**Anode (long leg) → Arduino pin**  
**Cathode (short leg) → resistor → GND**

---

### 🧠 Behavior Examples

| Pattern Name | Description |
|--------------|------------|
| Blink All | All LEDs turn ON → wait → OFF → repeat |
| Sequential | LED1 → LED2 → LED3 → repeat |
| Ping-Pong | 1 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 1 → repeat |

# 🔔 Day 04 — Buzzer Interfacing with Push Button & Slide Switch

Today’s focus was understanding how to generate sound using a **buzzer** and control it using different types of switches.  
This helped connect **input (switch)** with **output (sound)** — forming real embedded interaction.

---

## 🎯 What I Learned

✔ How buzzers work (active vs passive)  
✔ How to control sound using Arduino  
✔ How to use a **push button** as an input device  
✔ How to use a **slide switch** for stable ON/OFF control  
✔ How to apply **conditional logic (if/else)** based on switch states  
✔ How tone frequency affects how sound is perceived

## 🎧 Buzzer Types

| Type | Requires tone()? | Sound Type | Use Case |
|------|------------------|------------|----------|
| **Active Buzzer** | ❌ No | Fixed beep | Alerts / alarms |
| **Passive Buzzer** | ✔ Yes | Programmable tone | Music, variable sounds |

I used a **passive buzzer**, which allowed sound frequency changes using:
